#DC.js

[http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) is a Javascript library.
It uses d3.js and crossfilter.js to provide a multi-dimensional charting library.

##Typical use case

Building a dashboard, as the one shown on their homepage.
The library combines d3.js to draw charts and the power of crossfilter.js to ensure the multi-dimensionality.

In practice, the charts interact with each other.
For example, selecting a period of time on a line chart will take this period of time as reference to redraw all the other charts for this period. Magically.
