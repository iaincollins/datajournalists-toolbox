#Datawrapper

[Datawrapper](https://datawrapper.de/) is a nice online tool to quickly visualise and embed data-visualisations. No coding skills are required to use it, which makes it attractive.

##Typical use case

Because of its intuitive and simple GUI, I use Datawrapper a lot. Typically, I come accross a dataset I don't know, and I want to see in a second what it's telling me, before spending more time on it. 

I copy the CSV, paste it into Datawrapper, and *woosh*, I will have a rough idea of the trends in the dataset. 

Another use of Datawrapper's dead-simple interface is to create very quickly charts to either embed in an article or just share on social media. 

Note: huge files will definitely crash your browser. Use wisely. 

##Installation and use

* [Datawrapper's website](http://datawrapper.de) is the place to be. Create an account to store your charts. Have a look at the [Quickstart guide](http://docs.datawrapper.de/en/quickstart/)
* It's open-source, and you can [find it on Github](https://github.com/datawrapper/datawrapper). You can even build it yourself!
